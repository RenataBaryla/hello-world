# hello-world
My first attempt at GitHub.

Hi,
My name is Renata. I live in Zabrze (Poland).
I'm interested in programming since the 80's, when I was "programming" in Atari BASIC for the first time.
I have some expirience in programming, but so far I've programmed only for my personal use, e.g. I've written my own simple CMS and the invoicing system, both using html, css, php & mysql.
I recently joined FreeCodeCamp to learn something new and to use my skills in real projects.
